# TEKNIA — Technology Extracting Knowledge into Net Value Aggregation

## Manifesto (EU / Clean Aviation aligned)

---

## 1. Purpose and context

**TEKNIA** is a methodological framework to support **credible, evidence-based progress** in large-scale, regulated, and long-term industrial transitions, in particular those aligned with **EU climate, safety, and competitiveness objectives**.

It is designed for contexts where:

* multiple stakeholders contribute to a shared objective,
* uncertainty spans technology, certification, operations, and economics,
* safety and regulatory compliance are mandatory,
* and impact must be demonstrated beyond individual projects.

TEKNIA complements existing EU instruments such as **Horizon Europe**, **Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking**, and **European Green Deal** initiatives by providing a **common language to describe, measure, and aggregate knowledge-based progress**.

---

## 2. The systemic challenge

EU flagship programmes increasingly address **system-level transitions**, for example:

* climate-neutral aviation,
* sustainable energy systems,
* resilient infrastructure.

These challenges are characterised by:

* long development cycles,
* interdependence between technology, regulation, and operations,
* partial knowledge and evolving assumptions,
* contributions distributed across projects and actors.

In such environments, progress is often difficult to measure consistently, and early contributions that reduce uncertainty are not always visible or valued.

TEKNIA addresses this gap.

---

## 3. Foundational principle

> **Progress in complex transitions is achieved by reducing uncertainty in a verifiable and reusable manner.**

TEKNIA treats **uncertainty reduction** as the primary unit of value, rather than document production, isolated deliverables, or narrative claims.

---

## 4. NKU — Net Knowledge Unit

### Definition

**NKU (Net Knowledge Unit)**
**New Knowledge Understanding in Network Knots of Uncertainty**

An NKU is the **smallest verifiable increment of understanding** that reduces uncertainty at a specific point of interaction between technical, regulatory, operational, or economic factors.

NKUs are **technology-agnostic** and **market-neutral**.
They focus on *what is known*, not on who delivers or commercialises it.

### Characteristics of a valid NKU

An NKU must:

* identify the uncertainty addressed,
* define the baseline state,
* provide evidence (models, data, tests, analyses),
* bound the residual uncertainty,
* clarify its applicability and limitations.

Information that does not reduce uncertainty in a demonstrable way does not qualify as an NKU.

## 5. Knots of uncertainty: framing system transitions

Complex transitions cannot be decomposed into independent tasks from the outset.

TEKNIA models them as **networks of uncertainty knots**, where multiple dimensions interact, for example:

* technology readiness × certification pathways,
* operational feasibility × safety requirements,
* economic viability × policy constraints,
* infrastructure availability × deployment timelines.

A **knot** exists where progress is blocked unless several uncertainties are resolved together.

This framing aligns with EU **system-of-systems** and **transition pathway** approaches.

---

## 6. From global challenge to structured progress

TEKNIA applies a disciplined sequence:

1. **Global problem framing**
   A high-level NKU describes the overall uncertainty network (e.g. climate-neutral aviation within defined timeframes).

2. **Controlled decomposition**
   The global uncertainty is decomposed into identifiable knots.

3. **Targeted NKUs**
   Individual projects, studies, or demonstrations contribute NKUs that reduce uncertainty at specific knots.

This ensures coherence across projects and avoids fragmented or redundant effort.

---

## 7. TEKTOK — structuring exchange and governance

While NKUs describe **knowledge creation**, **TEKTOKs** describe **knowledge use and exchange**.

A **TEKTOK** is a governed, auditable construct that:

* references one or more NKUs,
* defines rights of use, reuse, and modification,
* specifies obligations, responsibilities, and context,
* allocates risk in line with regulatory and contractual frameworks.

In EU terms:

* NKUs align with **results and evidence**,
* TEKTOKs align with **exploitation, licensing, and operational deployment**.

---

## 8. Competition, collaboration, and EU programmes

EU programmes often combine:

* collaborative research,
* pre-competitive development,
* competitive procurement.

TEKNIA explicitly recognises that:

* multiple actors may contribute valid uncertainty reduction,
* not all value creation coincides with final system delivery,
* early knowledge can be a public or shared good.

This perspective is compatible with:

* **pre-commercial procurement (PCP)**,
* **innovation actions**,
* **co-funded partnerships**.

---

## 9. Investment, planning, and roadmaps

NKUs may originate from:

* technical research,
* regulatory analysis,
* operational demonstrations,
* or **investment and resource estimation**.

An investment-related NKU is valid when it:

* reduces uncertainty about feasibility, cost, or sequencing,
* is evidence-based,
* supports credible transition roadmaps.

This aligns with EU requirements for:

* realistic deployment pathways,
* cost-effectiveness assessment,
* risk-aware planning.

---

## 10. Aggregation and impact

TEKNIA supports aggregation of NKUs across:

* projects,
* work packages,
* programmes,
* and timeframes.

This enables:

* traceable contribution to high-level objectives (e.g. climate neutrality),
* avoidance of double counting,
* transparent assessment of progress.

Impact is expressed as **measurable reduction of uncertainty**, rather than solely as technology maturity claims.

---

## 11. Long-term transitions and public value

Transitions such as climate-neutral aviation extend beyond single funding cycles.

TEKNIA supports:

* knowledge continuity across programmes,
* reuse of validated results,
* recognition of contributions with long-term public value.

This is consistent with the EU focus on:

* sustainability,
* strategic autonomy,
* long-term industrial competitiveness.

---

## 12. What TEKNIA is (and is not)

**TEKNIA is:**

* a methodological alignment layer,
* a common epistemic framework,
* a support to evidence-based governance.

**TEKNIA is not:**

* a replacement for EU funding rules,
* a certification framework,
* or a commercialisation mechanism.

It complements existing structures by making knowledge value explicit and comparable.

---

## 13. Guiding principles (EU-aligned)

* Evidence-based progress
* Transparency of assumptions
* System-level coherence
* Responsible uncertainty management
* Reusability and traceability

## 14. Closing statement

> **Achieving climate-neutral and sustainable aviation requires not only innovation, but shared, verifiable understanding.
> TEKNIA exists to make that understanding visible, measurable, and reusable across the European ecosystem.**
