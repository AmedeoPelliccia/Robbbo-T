## What is IDEALEEU?

**IDEALEEU** is a strategic and technical framework designed to help complex industries **make progress on problems that cannot be solved by a single actor**.

It focuses on situations where:

* uncertainty is systemic,
* responsibilities are distributed,
* safety and regulation matter,
* and value is created long before products are delivered.

IDEALEEU does not propose products or technologies.
It provides a **common structure to understand problems, measure progress, and recognize value** across organizations.

---

## The core problem IDEALEEU addresses

Many large programs fail not because of a lack of ideas, but because:

* uncertainty is fragmented,
* contributions are invisible or unrewarded,
* competition discourages knowledge sharing,
* and strategic decisions are made without clear evidence.

This is especially true in domains such as:

* civil aerospace,
* energy transition,
* safety-critical infrastructure,
* regulated industrial ecosystems.

IDEALEEU addresses this by treating progress as **reduction of uncertainty**, not as accumulation of documents or promises.

## NKU — Net Knowledge Unit

At the foundation of IDEALEEU is the **NKU (Net Knowledge Unit)**.

**NKU = New Knowledge Understanding in Network Knots of Uncertainty**

An NKU is:

* the smallest verifiable gain in understanding,
* that reduces uncertainty at a specific **knot**,
* within a network of interdependent uncertainties.

A knot is where multiple concerns intersect (e.g. technology × certification × cost × operations).

An NKU exists only if:

* the uncertainty is explicitly stated,
* evidence is provided,
* residual uncertainty is bounded,
* and downstream impact is identified.

Information without uncertainty reduction is **not** an NKU.

---

## Knots: how IDEALEEU frames complex problems

IDEALEEU models complex challenges as **networks of knots**, not as linear roadmaps.

Examples of knots:

* transitioning civil aerospace to carbon-neutral or net-positive operation,
* certifying disruptive technologies under existing regulations,
* aligning industrial transformation with long asset lifecycles,
* coordinating infrastructure, policy, and market adoption.

Knots cannot be solved by one technology or one company.
They require **distributed contributions**, each reducing part of the uncertainty.

## TEKTOK — value exchange and governance

While NKUs describe **knowledge value**, **TEKTOKs** describe **value exchange**.

A **TEKTOK** is the governed, auditable wrapper that captures:

* which NKUs are shared,
* under what rights and obligations,
* within which context (licence, SLA, program, policy),
* and with what risk allocation.

In simple terms:

* **NKU** defines *what is known*,
* **TEKTOK** defines *how that knowledge is exchanged and used*.

This separation avoids conflating knowledge creation with contracts or pricing.

---

## Why this matters for large programs

In traditional models:

* only final deliverables are rewarded,
* early uncertainty resolution is unpaid,
* losing bidders subsidize the winner,
* and strategic knowledge is kept opaque.

IDEALEEU enables:

* recognition of contributions **before competition outcomes**,
* fair compensation for uncertainty reduction,
* collaboration without loss of attribution,
* and more credible, lower-risk programs.

This is essential for transitions that span decades and institutions.

## IDEALEEU and AMPEL360

AMPEL360 is an example of a challenge space where IDEALEEU applies.

No single organization can design, certify, fund, and operate a net-positive aerospace system alone.

IDEALEEU provides:

* a shared problem framing,
* a way to map strategic knots,
* a method to value contributions from many actors,
* and a governance language compatible with regulation and procurement.

IDEALEEU does **not** replace programs like AMPEL360.
It defines the **conditions under which such programs can be built coherently**.

## What this repository contains

This repository contains:

* conceptual definitions (NKU, TEKTOK, knots),
* methodological foundations,
* mathematical and systems modeling references,
* example application domains (e.g. energy capture, control, transition pathways).

It is a **foundation repository**, not a product repository.

---

## What this repository is not

This repository is not:

* marketing material,
* a product catalogue,
* a business pitch deck,
* or a finished solution.

It is a **shared intellectual and operational framework**.

---

## Who this is for

IDEALEEU is relevant to:

* system architects and chief engineers,
* program and portfolio leaders,
* regulators and certification bodies,
* infrastructure and energy stakeholders,
* investors focused on long-term, real assets.

If you work on problems where **no single actor has the full answer**, IDEALEEU is designed for you.

## Getting started

* Read the TEKNIA Manifesto: `docs/TEKNIA/TEKNIA-Manifesto.md`
* Explore the methodological tools: `tools/teknia-tools/`
* Review example uncertainty knots and NKUs
* Engage by proposing or resolving a knot

## Guiding principle

> **Progress is not measured by how much we claim to know,
> but by how much uncertainty we can responsibly remove together.**
